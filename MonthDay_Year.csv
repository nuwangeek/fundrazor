"1,010",Have a HEART for HACHR - Help us get a new Mobile Clinic!,U.S. Dollar,,of $15k goal,17,"In 7 years, HACHR has traveled all over Humboldt County, to provide
  outreach, support, services, and respect to unhoused individuals and
  people who use drugs. We travel hundreds of miles each week--meeting
  our participants where they are at, literally--to
    provide sterile syringe exchange services, overdose prevention
    supplies and education, hepatitis C testing and linkage to
    treatment, care coordination, compassion, and respect for our
    marginalized neighbors in Humboldt County.  In 2020 alone, HACHR has
    played a part in reversing 145 overdoses, distributed over 2,400
    naloxone kits and hundreds of hygiene and wound care kits, provided hot food and cold weather supplies to our unhoused
    neighbors, and supported over 75 individuals in enrolling in
    medication-assisted treatment--the majority of whom we met on
    outreach across the county. As COVID-19 continues to  push people who use drugs further out
    of stable housing and into the shadows, it is imperative
      that we continue to provide top-notch health and supportive care
      across Humboldt, and to
        do that, we need a mobile clinic. A mobile clinic will allow HACHR staff to travel far and wide
    across remote and urban parts of Humboldt County, including
    hard-to-reach and marginalized communities, with everything they
    need to provide instant support and services: a space for HIV/HCV
    testing and meetings with case managers, enough storage for harm
    reduction supplies like syringes and naloxone, plumbing and
    electricity to store tests and supplies and charge tablets and
    participant devices, and a reliable engine that will keep us going
    for a hundred thousand miles and then some. Every dollar raised will go directly to getting HACHR more
      mobile--purchasing a van, transforming it into a mobile clinic,
      paying for parking and storage, and getting it registered and
      insured. Gifts are fully tax deductible. If you support harm reduction in Humboldt County, please
    consider getting us on the road with a donation, and sharing this
    with your networks!  And watch this space--we'll be sharing updates
    and testimonials from our incredible HACHR community here. PS: Fundrazr includes a ""tip"" on every gift to

"6,105",Support Urban Care's Community Healthcare,U.S. Dollar,,of $6k goal,36,"At Urban Care Clinic our vision is to make quality healthcare
    accessible to everyone. In order to achieve that goal, we have made
    our services available to surrounding communities free of charge,
    who would otherwise not be able to afford that and would have no
    equivalent alternative. We started small and in the past months we
    could extend our range of services and availability to 3 days per
    week, where we are treating patients free of charge. At the moment,
    every week we are seeing and treating up to 60 patients for free,
    which amounts to 250-300 patients per month. We are usually financing these activities from an allocated
    percentage of our monthly turnover. As we are heavily affected by
    COVID as well with a significant reduction in paying patients and
    left with a growing number of patients with little financial means,
    we are reaching out to you. We want to continue this vital service.
    It has become an important part of our communities in Nyamanzi and
    Dimani, we have chronically ill patients relying on this. Anticipating that tourism will slowly start to recover earliest
    by end of the year / beginning of 2021, we want to ensure that we
    can continue to make our healthcare services available to everyone,
    throughout this time. An average of USD20 is used per patient for exams, treatments
    and interventions. You can choose to contribute once or opt for a recurring monthly
    contribution. You have the choice between funding the treatment of 1
    patient or multiple. If you are not able to contribute financially
    at the moment, you can support us by sharing the campaign in your network! Along the time this campaign will run, we will keep updating you

  San Diego News: https://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/feature/call-for-citizen-scientists-to-contribute-to-covid-19-studies ____________________________________________________________________________________________ This is a unique, open collaboration between the TwinsUK team at King's College London and The American Gut Project (AGP) / The Microsetta Initiative to expand the study of the bacterial diversity to
    participants in Europe. If you are a participant living outside Europe and would like
    to participate, please refer to our American Gut Fundrazr page . Many
  people don't realize that the bacteria that live inside us play an
  incredibly important role in our health. There are so many of them:
  They make up 50 percent of the cells in our body and their most
  important jobs include manufacturing vitamins for us and breaking down
  and digesting our food. The trillions of bacteria in our gut weigh
  nearly 2 kg (over 4lbs). This community of bacteria can be thought of
  as an extra 'organ' which we call our ""microbiome"".  Recent
  research has discovered that small changes in this finely balanced
  community can affect our immune system, metabolism, body weight, mood
  and may even cause diseases such as Crohn's disease, irritable bowel
  syndrome, cancer, autoimmune disease, diabetes and heart disease. This is the first project of its kind in Europe, as an extension
    of the American Gut Project & The Microsetta Initiative, based
    at the University of California San Diego.  We have collaborated
    with TwinsUK at King’s College London so that those living in Europe
    can participate, and with your help, we will be able to discover
    more about the crucial relationship between our health and our
    microbiome, and on a personal level, you will be able to discover
    the bacterial profile of your own gut. With your help, we hope to be
    able to answer questions such as 'How much does our choice of
    lifestyle and diet influence our microbiome, and can we alter our
    microbiome to make us healthier?' We are discovering that each person is very different and has
    their own unique microbiome. More research is needed to work out
    what constitutes a 'healthy' microbiome, and which combinations of
    bacteria are beneficial and which ones should be avoided. In order
    to do this ambitious and much-needed project, we urgently need a
    large scale collection of human samples. Over ten thousand people
    have already signed up in America already through the American Gut
    Project-- but we need many more from Europe. The project mainly focuses on the gut as this is our main
    'microbial home', however, the study will also look at areas like
    the oral and skin, as these areas of the body may be influenced by
    the microbiome. Joining is simple! Select the kit you would like from the list
    of options on the left-hand side by clicking “Claim this perk” found
    on the right side (if you would like to receive a specific number of
    kits that isn’t listed as a perk, email us at info@britishgut.org ). You will receive your kit within 3 weeks after payment. Shipping within the U.K. first class should be around £2.90, but
    we recommend taking the sample to the post office to get the proper
    postage. Getting the postage right on the first try is important
    since samples that spend a long time in transit will likely not
    produce the highest quality results. After you have returned your
    sample to us, we will then sent it to the Knight Lab at the
    University of California San Diego to be processed and
  analyzed. We typically bulk ship samples back to the Knight
  Lab about every 2 months on dry ice to reduce shipping costs. Once
  your sample arrives at the Knight Lab (you'll get a notification when
  they have received your sample), processing takes 3-4
    months. We estimate that the whole process will take about
    4-6 months. Each kit contains a sample collection device (or multiple if you
    ordered more than one), an instruction packet on how to sample, and
    return envelope(s) to send your sample tube(s) back. Once we provide you with your results, you will receive data
    visualization of how your results compare to other people who are
    within the same diet and lifestyle group as you (having different
    results from them does not necessarily mean anything bad, it can
    just be that you have different lifestyles that make bacterial
    profile is different).   In addition, you will be provided with a
    list of the major groups of bacteria in your sample and their
    relative abundances (based at the genus level). These results are not actionable,
      and we do not provide any personalized
  interpretation . Results are uploaded via our
  participant website, which you will get access to once you register
  your kit. It will take longer than the expected 4-6 months to receive
      results if you are submitting one of the following sample types: Oral or skin samples. A desktop computer or laptop is recommended to register and log your sample into our
      participant portal website, as our participant website has
      compatibility issues on mobile devices and tablets.  The best
      browser to use when you register your kit is Google Chrome. Note your de-identified information will be part of a
      research study and will be made available in a publicly available
      research database. That is, any personal information that might
      easily identify who you are will be removed before being placed in
      the public database. If you decide that you no longer wish to continue in this
      study, please send a request to the British Gut Project help
      account ( info@britishgut.org ) to inform us of your intent to withdraw. You may request a
      refund within 50 days of your original payment if you have not yet used your kit. Please note that
    the Fundrazr transaction fee will be deducted from your refund. The consent forms are maintained on the participant website;
      details are included in your kit. To sign the consent form, you

"2,850",Please help me #keepmoving #outdoors with an #Alinker Walking Bike.,Canadian Dollar,,of $2.8k goal,39,"Hi! I’m David. Please help me #keepmoving outdoors with an #Alinker
  Walking Bike. I'm a single Dad and would love to be able to enjoy the
  outdoors again with my daughter and friends. Diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis at age 2, I spent most of my
  youth in and out of a wheelchair and in and out of hospitals. After
  many years and total joint replacements in both hips and knees, I
  became more mobile and began participating in outdoor activities with
  the assistance of several local non-profit groups that assist the
  disabled in the participation of sports such as hiking, kayaking,
  sailing and more. However, in early 2018, I had to have a second knee replacement (on
  the same knee) and later that year, I fell and since then, I have not
  been able to walk without assistance.  I currently use crutches
  outside and a walker in the home.  I have not participated in any
  outdoor activities for over a year. I no longer go for walks, regular
  grocery shopping, go to malls or other public venues.  Walking with
  crutches while having Rheumatoid Arthritis causes added pain in my
  back, neck and shoulders.  This pain along with an overall fear of
  falling prevents me from going out, enjoying the great outdoors in New
  England and being socially active as I had been before the knee
  replacement and subsequent fall. I attend Physical Therapy several
  days a week and am trying to get some strength back. The #Alinker is a three-wheeled walking bike designed to help people
  stay active and live life to the fullest allowing users experience
  chronic aches and pains, chronic illnesses and recovering from an
  injury, they can all still be active! Currently, Health Insurance
  plans do not cover a very broad range of mobility devices and that’s
  why campaigns like this are so important. I'd be able to rebuild and
  maintain muscle tone in my legs, be able to walk upright instead of
  using all my energy focusing on trying not to fall and once again
  enjoy my time outdoors and with family and friends without the feeling
  like I'm slowing everyone down. It may even allow me to return to
  scuba diving as I'd be able to use the #Alinker to walk the trail down
  to the water's edge at Ft. Wetherill park in Jamestown, RI.  to It
  really would give me so much freedom back, open up my world again, and
  change my life. To learn more about my life’s journey, please visit me

    trillions of microbes that inhabit our bodies and their impact on
    health and disease. However, opportunities for the public to get
    involved in such research have been limited. Now, American Gut gives
    you an opportunity to join this research project and learn what’s
    living on and inside you. American Gut is a project built on the open-source, open-access
    principles of the Earth Microbiome Project. The data we collect is
    de-identified and then deposited into open repositories for the
    benefit of other researchers and scientists.  By participating in
    our project, you can help contribute to research that will help the
    world understand how the microbiome affects our health. In exchange

"2,002",Help Us Make Ireland's Dream a Reality!,U.S. Dollar,,of $500k goal,29,"Hello, we are Megan and Mark. Over three years ago Megan gave birth
  to our beautiful baby girl, Ireland. However, during birth, an
  umbilical cord prolapse resulted in Ireland having cererbal palsy. She
  spent the first 7 weeks of life in the hospital, and we waitied
  anxiously to take her home to her older brothers. This was our first real world experience with cerebral palsy. Many
  people we talk to today don't even know what cerebral palsy is.
  Cerebral palsy is a variable type of brain injury that affects people
  in many different ways. Some children are only slightly affected,
  while others are permamently disabled, wheelchair-bound, and need
  constant attendant care. Cerebral palsy makes a huge impact on the family dynamic. Not only
  are many cerebral palsy families financially dessimated by this
  disease, but they are also stressed emotionally and physically. There are no treatments out there that are covered by insurance to
  treat or reverse cererbal palsy. However, there are many, many
  therapies available worldwide that improve cerebral palsy, and can
  have significant impacts on quality of life. Unfortunately, most of
  these therapies are difficult to obtain due to lack of insurance
  coverage and travel costs. We were lucky enough to discover and utilize many of these therapies
  for Ireland, and have seen dramatic improvements in her since using
  these therapies. We truly believe that no child with cerebral palsy
  should have his or her treatment options limited by his or her
  parent's financial status. Out of this belief, Ireland's Dream was born. Ireland's Dream is to establish a medical center that is fully
  dedicated to the treatment of people with cerebral palsy and their
  families. This Center will have the latest in treatment technologies
  that people all over the world are using for cerebral palsy, available
  under one roof. These therapies include hyperbaric oxygen, ozone
  therapy, Cuevas Medek therapy, scoliosis treatment, and vibration
  therapy. Other necessary therapies will include family counseling,
  diet/nutritional interventions, feeding therapy, assistive device
  training, and more. Our goal is to make cerebral palsy synonymous with Ireland's Dream.
  Please help us make Ireland's Dream come true for patients all over
  the country who are suffering from the debilitating disease. We thank you greatly for any support you can provide.",https://fundrazr.com/f13EF1

  meant to inspire and inform teenagers about preparing their own
  snacks. The 3 day workshop will be led by Beth Gates who has been
  involved with promoting cooking and teaching cooking classes to teens
  for over 8 years in the Portland area. Each day she will bring a new
  recipe for the students to make themselves: quick pickles, smoothies,
  and fancy toast. The goal is that students will have the knowledge to
  prepare snacks that are: delicious, affordable, nutritious , and are
  informed by sustainable practices (low packaging etc) Students will be
  eating the food they prepare as well as collecting recipes, and taking
  home their own pickles. They will also be given instruction on what it
  means to shop within a growing season and using seasonal fruits and
  vegetables. As sixth graders, many students are now home alone after
  school and are preparing snacks, if not meals, for themselves. I feel
  it is important to empower them to make informed choices about the
  food they eat. Last year, Beth taught a one “smoothie” making
    lesson to our 6th grade students and it was described as a highlight
    of the year by the kids. Beth Gates is part of the CookFirst Collective. The mission of
    the collective is to cultivate home cooking, cooking with
    ingredients “on-hand” or seasonably available, and to inspire risk

    current situation at this hospital. The information below has been
    retrieved from the following article: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/25/inside-venezuelas-top-childrens-medical-unit-where-patients-are/ “ This is dangerous for you and for me. There’s a real climate of
    fear”, says the doctor as he sits nervously in a room off intensive
    care at the JM de Los Rios Children’s Hospital in Caracas. Dr Huniades Urbina is trying to expose the desperate shortage of
    drugs and medical supplies in what should be the best equipped
    paediatric unit in Venezuela, but he is taking a great risk. Huge numbers of medicines are now hard or impossible to find,
    from antibiotics and painkillers to anti-epilepsy and chemotherapy drugs. D r Urbina says the unit has gone back to methods and medications
    used decades ago, because of the shortages. Where once they had
    state of the art chemotherapy for cancer patients he says they now
    have to make do with lesser options. “Sometimes people die because
    of these shortages, even here in the best children’s intensive care
    unit in Venezuela”, he says Testing kits for blood and other disposables are also scarce.
    The hospital has taken to boiling and reusing items that are
    supposed to be for single-use. When challenged on the dangers of
    this Dr Urbina’s junior colleague Dr Alvarez agrees but says they
    have no choice” The intensive care unit is operating with a reduced number of
    beds. That is partly due to the shortages of supplies, and also
    because of the shortage of doctors. Around 10,000 are estimated to
    have left the country in recent years. “ We do our best to help because this is what makes sense
      to do in cases like this.",https://fundrazr.com/jmdelosrios

    trade by human traffickers that exploit their vulnerability. Most
    are Indigenous. The pimps and traffickers, who expect their victims
    to work everyday, rake in an average of $280,000/year per victim.
    The girls and women, who usually have no access to family and
    friends and fear harm from their traffickers, are trapped. The pandemic has reduced their escape options even more. ""More safe
    houses are needed where victims can go to escape. There were many

  it , and the people who is surround. Due to this pathology,
  the routine, habits and custom of the child and the family, are
  strongly altered. Chemonkey is a project for kids who are living chemotherapy process,
  during the investigation, we realized that there wasn't any
    guide that the parents could use to explain their kids what
  they were living or were about to live. This is a hard task to do,
  because they don't know how to do it and the proper words to use. The
  main aim of this project is to ensure the kid's emotional well-being,
  to improve his experience and also to prepare him, so that he can
  face, in a better way, all the process. Chemonkey works as a tool for explaining, by an optimistic way and
  with proper words, the treatment and the side effects of it. So kids
  could understand their illness. The main character of the book is a
  monkey, who already lived the treatment, it shares his experience and
  will be their new best friend, who will share all this time with them.
  It increases kid's well being and help them to say their feelings,
  what really matters during this time. (We tested the prototypes with three kids, in all of them
    increased their self esteem , some of them believed that if her monkey could do it, she could
    too. They became brave and stop cover their eyes because of the
    needles. Also, it helps to the parents, because kids reflected
    themselves in the monkey, so if the monkey wants to sleep, they are
    trying to say that they're tired, so that is really helpful for the
    parents to know the emotions of their child) Please consider giving a donation to this project, any amount will
  help. Whether you can give or not, please share this widely with
  friends on facebook, twitter, e-mail, or any other social media. The more people who see this project, more kids will be
  happy - developing physical, emotional, spiritual, mental and

135,Cannabis Therapeutics Certification,U.S. Dollar,,of $10k goal,7,"This year we are celebrating 15 years since the American
    Alliance for Medical Cannabis was founded. Dr. Jay Cavanaugh created
    AAMC to help patients and to educate health professionals, lawmakers
    and the general public about the therapeutic uses of Cannabis. We
    have come a long way since 2001. We now have AAMC Directors in 21
    States, and 26 States plus the District of Columbia have legal
    medical marijuana. The most common question patients ask is “Where can I find a
    doctor who can help me?” Most doctors have not had a chance to learn
    about medical cannabis. They didn’t learn about the endocannabinoid
    system in medical school and they are reluctant to talk about it. The American Alliance for Medical Cannabis is dedicated to
    helping patients. We need your support to increase our staff so that
    we can identify qualified health professionals and provide patients
    with quality medical care. By becoming AAMC certified clinics, health professionals will
    demonstrate that they are informed about the therapeutic use of
    Cannabis. AAMC is trusted by patients. We understand the needs of
    patients. Patients will know that they are being cared for by
    competent doctors. Patients have the right to talk about their use
    of Cannabis with people who know that it’s not just for fun. Our goal is to develop clinics where patients can get complete
    medical care from doctors who know how Cannabis helps. If you would
    like to help, please give AAMC a generous donation today. AAMC certified clinics provide: * Knowledgeable doctors and nurses * Cannabis is part of initial treatment plan when indicated. * Clinics are typical doctor's offices * Full service health care The goal is to develop clinics that have knowledgeable staff to
    deliver patient care.",https://fundrazr.com/MedicalCannabis

  teachers at Chehalem Elementary and we have way too much fun teaching

  nature of our gym and stage situation, we are unable to use a
  projector set-up because the chords would be a tripping hazard to
  students. We also would like to use a projector during the morning
  times to get the kids moving several days a week before classes begin. Therefore a rear facing projector screen with an Apple TV hooked up
  to the projector would be an amazing addition to our Physical
  Education program as well as a helpful tool for the whole school to
  use every day.  We would have a projector set-up behind the rear
  screen on the stage so no chords would be on the gym floor. We have
  access to iPads that we would airplay through the Apple TV onto the
  screen. The possibilities are endless for a system like this in our gymnasium. We would greatly appreciate your help in funding our project and
  sharing it with your friends and family.  We look forward to all the
  benefits these learning tools will provide all students at Chehalem.

  ties. All funds go directly towards the cost of medical care. In 2016 fundraiser we raised $7,745.00, $1,235 more than the
  goal! The projected expenses for  medical care (including
  hospitalization, consults, labs, x-rays, scans, medicines,
  transportation, etc) for 2017 equates to $789.31 per month or $9471.73
  for the whole year. After we deducted the $1,235 ""excess"" we
  raised last year, the total goal for 2017 is $8,400. This puts us just past the financial goal. The reason for the increase in the budget this year is: The Quetzal has strengthened substantially compared to the
      USD, previously it was 7.75/1, now it is down to 7.3/1. Over the last year we have increased our numbers to 679

"5,932",Ride to Give - An Adaptive Bike for Rosalee,U.S. Dollar,,of $5.8k goal,150,"4 and 1/2 years ago, Jessica and Aaron Truelove were
  excitedly awaiting the birth of their first child.  Jessica's
  pregnancy had seemed typical, but Rosalee was born at 28 weeks
  weighing 1lb 15oz. The night she was born, Rosalee had a pulmonary hemorrhage causing
    her fight for life to become even more difficult. For a tiny baby like Rosalee, the chances of her surviving
    prematurity AND the pulmonary hemorrhage were slim. Rosalee ended up spending 73 days in the NICU. At her discharge cranial ultrasound
      on day 69, Jessica and Aaron were told that Rosalee had suffered
      from a brain injury called Periventricular
  Leukomalacia. Her doctors were not sure when this injury
  occurred, but it was sometime between birth and day
  69. Periventricular Leukomalacia (PVL) is characterized by the death
  of the white matter of the brain due to  lack of oxygen or blood flow
  to the periventricular area of the brain. Babies with PVL are at risk
  for motor disorders, delayed mental development, coordination
  problems, and vision and hearing impairments. PVL may be accompanied
  by a hemorrhage or bleeding in the periventricular-intraventricular
  area (the area around and inside the ventricles) and can lead to
  cerebral palsy. The disorder is diagnosed by ultrasound of the head,
  as was what the case with Rosalee. Since knowing about her injury early on, Rosalee's doctors were able
  to prescribe interventions which were key to giving Rosalee the best
  possible outcome. As soon as Rosalee was discharged from the NICU, she
  began in-home therapy sessions while she grew stronger and less at
  risk for common germs. During these early months, the hardest part
  with Rosalee's initial diagnosis of PVL was the waiting game. The
  Trueloves became consumed with what Rosalee was or wasn't doing on
  time, basically putting her under a developmental microscope. When Rosalee was around 6-8 months, it became apparent that she
    was becoming increasingly delayed in her fine and gross motor
    skills, but it was not until she was 18 months that the Trueloves
    received the official diagnosis of Spastic Diplegia Cerebral Palsy . Jessica and Aaron continue to work with Rosalee daily to help improve
  her mobility and build her strength. Rosalee receives multiple
  therapies weekly, and as far as her prognosis, her neurologist and
  developmental specialist feel like she will eventually be able to walk
  with assistance for a short distance, but will spend her life
  primarily in a wheelchair. In September, Rosalee will become a big
  sister and the Trueloves are working extra hard this summer to keep
  her on track. One of the things that Rosalee's therapists suggested to help
  strengthen her core and build independence is an adaptive bicycle,
  like the ones sold by www.freedomconcepts.com . Cycling
  would offer her greater independence, a creative way to increase her
  mobility, and most importantly a way to connect with her parents
  through outdoor exercise. The staff at Freedom Concepts have
    visited with Rosalee and found the perfect size bike for
  her use now and to grow with her for years to come. Unfortunately, the
  Trueloves' insurance will not cover the cost so Freedom Concepts
  suggested they reach out to Ride to Give. Ride to Give is excited to offer the Truloves support in
    purchasing an adaptive bicycle for Rosalee.  We have seen time and
    again how alternative therapies, like cycling, can make a
    significant impact on medically complex children like Rosalee.
    Please help us purchase Rosalee a Freedom Concepts Bicycle so she
    can enjoy a life of inclusion rather than one of exclusion. At this time, Rosalee does not have a Facebook Page of her own,
      so follow Ride to Give on Facebook for all updates. Contributions are solicited with the understanding that the
      donee organization (Ride to Give, 501c3 tax ID 46-2952297) has
      complete discretion and control over the use of all donated funds.

500,It all started with a Ray......,U.S. Dollar,,of $400 goal,12,"It all started with A Ray.... and together we can make many more shine.... This all started with a Ray, our Ray, to be more accurate. My
      good friend, Claudia and I, had just moved her mountain Boutique
      to a new location and it needed a new fresh look. She brought in
      Ray, probably the gentlest and sweetest soul, to do the job.
      ""You pick it, I paint it"" he would say each day he came
      in. What I didn't know was that he wasn't just using a catchy
      slogan.  Over the week he spent with us I came to find our Ray is
      color blind and has been for the 76 years he has been on this
      wonderful world. Ray never had an opinion on the colors or chose
      them himself because he could not see the shades as we did. As I watched him carefully tape off the corners and windows
      and gentle apply the mint green and merlot red to our walls I
      realized that Ray would never be able to see how truly beautiful
      his work was. In between stories of his rowdy youth and extra
      coats of paint on the walls it dawned on me that Claudia and I
      could do something special for Ray to help say thank you for all
      his work.... EnChroma Glasses! So, I went online and started
    harassing all my friends and neighbors. SURELY! SOMEONE had to have
    a pair of those fancy glasses we could borrow. In my search a
    community member mentioned that there must be many more in our
    community that could benefit. The decision to start a fund for a
    permanent publicly available pair was made. All we needed to do was
    find a home where people could access them. Luckily, we didn't have
    to look far. Neighbor to the Boutique is Wild Bear Nature Center,
    Boulder County's only all ages, non-profit nature center. WILD BEAR NATURE CENTER Wild Bear Nature Center sees about
    27,000 visitors through its door every year. With a passion for
    re-connecting all ages with Nature as well as educating the
    importance of taking care of this beautiful earth, we believe that
    this is the home for our Enchroma glasses. THE PERFECT HOME.
    Utilizing Wild Bears ability to direct people to nature hikes, snow
    shoeing or one of their superb programs, we can create exceptionally
    magical mountain moments for Color Deficient seers that will last a
    life time. Imagine the oranges and reds of the Aspens to an eight
    year old who has never seen those shades before. Or imagine seeing
    the deep hues of our back country for the very first time for
    someone who has spent their whole lives in the Rockies. All the funds collected will be
      used to purchase a pair of EnChroma glasses that will be available
      for any one with Color Deficiency to rent free of charge. Any
      remaining funds will be used to make an exhibit for the center
      explaining Color Deficiency and Blindness as well as educating
      visitors how other animals see color. And of course we will have a
      special night with Ray, the reason this all started. Thank you for spending the time to
    read our story. We greatly appreciate any and all donations. WHAT IS ENCHROMA? Over 300 million people worldwide are affected by red-green color
  vision deficiency, also called color blindness. Enchroma has created
  glasses which enhance color vision without the compromise of color
  accuracy. Enchroma glasses are an optical assistive device; they are not
      a cure for color blindness. Results vary depending on the type and
      extent of color vision deficiency per individual. The glasses are
      estimated to be effective for 4 out of 5 cases (80%) of red-green
      color vision deficiency – prospective users are encouraged to take
      our online color vision test to assess the likelihood of efficacy. Enchroma does not
      endorse use of the glasses to pass occupational screening tests
      such as the Ishihara test. For more information please read the FAQs , learn about the Enchroma technology and story , or contact customer support . Check out these reactions",https://fundrazr.com/21SXlb

    creative process and its many forms. I love trying new things
    because I'm always up for a good challenge. However, I'm facing a
    pretty big challenge of a different sort currently and would really
    appreciate your help. I've lived with mobility issues since the age of
    nine, because of multiple spinal issues, but mostly due to multiple
    arachnoid cysts filled with fluid at the base of my spine which are
    compressing my nerves. I've had surgery to drain it in 2001, and it
    was stable for many years but recent MRIs have shown that it's
    become filled with fluid once again. Medically, I'm figuring out
    what my options are at the moment. In October of 2015, I woke up to feeling like there was a
    piece of tape stuck to the bottom of my right foot. Since then I've
    had multiple EMGs and MRIs done and am still left with not a lot of
    answers or solutions. Due to a combination of my complicated case
    and the scar tissue from my previous surgery, multiple neurosurgeons
    have told me they're not comfortable attempting another... so I'm
    left with a situation I need to find my own solution for. To get an idea of what I'm working with here, here's a picture
    of a ""healthy"" spine vs my spine: If you feel like deciphering doctor language, here's my most
    recent MRI report: ( Right-click on the pic > Open image in new tab to see it at full resolution) In summation: YIKES. What does this mean for me currently? Chronic Pain Numbness in my right foot makes it so I can't
      feel the floor when I go to take a step, therefore, balance issues I haven't been able to walk without a cane
      since 2016 I'm not able to walk very far, even with a
      cane, so I've been essentially housebound for these last few
      years, and boy, would I love not to be! I'm reliant on my brother and sister-in-law
      for anything that requires me to leave the house. (They are the
      best and don't mind, but I'd rather not have to!) So... What would the Alinker do for me? I'd be able to leave the house by myself(!!!) I could go get the mail! Grocery stores would once again be within my reach Unlike a wheelchair, I'd be able to rebuild
      and maintain muscle tone in my legs Be able to have a conversation while walking
      again instead of using all my energy focusing on trying not to fall I could enjoy my time at events, festivals,
      family trips, etc. without feeling like I'm slowing everyone down Having a seat with me at all times would be a
      dream come true I could explore the neighborhood and all its
      cool historic sites I could take my nieces to the park I could walk the family dog I would be closer to being as cool as Selma Blair It really would give me so much freedom back,

"2,800",Help me stay #unstoppable with an Alinker walking bike!,Canadian Dollar,,of $2.8k goal,21,"My name is Julia and even though I was born with cerebral palsy it
  is not usually a way I ever describe myself. Growing up I did not put
  limits on myself and what I could or could not do. I always tried if
  it was something I wanted to do I tried and tried again. Sometimes it
  didn’t work out but most times, I could figure out a way to get things
  done. As I’ve become an adult I’m not as strong as I once was, but I
  have yet to give up my “unstoppable” spirit. Throughout the years I
  have found different ways to help myself stay independent and mobile.
  These have included surgeries, and therapy, a wheelchair, and my
  greatest blessing; a beautiful Mobility service dog named Hope. Read more about Hope and I
    here Although these have all been things that have changed my life for the
  better,  I still struggle with daily tasks. One of the best things
  about my wheelchair is that I can get out and go places without
  overexerting myself, but one of the worst things about my wheelchair
  is, I still need to ask for assistance more often than I would like
  because things are often out of reach  and I do worry that I am losing
  what little strength I do have in my legs when using my chair.  The
  day I was browsing online and an ad for the Alinker walking bike came
  up I thought to myself that is really cool and I shared it so other
  people could see it too, but  when I went back and started reading
  about it I realized that not only would it be good for other people,
  But it could be an excellent tool for ME! Not only would I be more
  upright and able to do more things on my own I would also be able to
  stay active and use my legs without completely exhausting myself.
  Since I’ve been keeping up with the Alinker, I’ve noticed one really
  interesting thing when you see it out somewhere , you don’t
  immediately think oh look a poor disabled person but rather oh that’s
  cool I wonder where they got it? I would like to thank anyone who is

"9,146",Ride to Give - Supporting Cezar's Cancer Journey,U.S. Dollar,,of $9k goal,444,"On Sunday, May 21st, 2017, six members of Team Ride to Give participated in Ironman 70.3 Chattanooga on
    behalf 3-year-old Cezar Maldonado. They were: Kevin Baxter 2166 * Beth Berger 715 Bill Halstead 619 * Morgan Hendricks 540 David Nazaroff 687 * Carol Zrybko 1640 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ And on Saturday, May 21st, Leigh Roberts Duquette participated in the Dina LaVigna Breath of Life
        Ventura Triathlon . ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ On July 12th, 2013, David and Rebecca Maldonado of Dayton, TN, along
  with big brother Izaiah, welcomed baby Cezar into their family.  Life
  for the Maldonados was wonderfully full and felt perfect until May of
  2016 when for no apparent reason Cezar began limping.  His first
  hospital stay was on May 19th, 2016 where he had three x-rays, an MRI,
  and fluid removed from his hip, knee, and ankle. Cezar was
  subsequently sent home, and his parents were given no definitive
  answers as to why their sweet toddler was limping. They returned to
  his primary care physician a few weeks later when they were told
  Cezar’s blood work came back abnormal and that his liver and spleen
  were enlarged. Cezar was directly admitted to the hematology/oncology unit at Children’s Hospital at
    Erlanger in Chattanooga where his parents were told their
    3-year-old had pre-b cell Acute Lymphoblastic
      Leukemia (ALL) which has a survival rate of 95%. In a
  child with ALL, too many stem cells become lymphoblasts, B
  lymphocytes, or T lymphocytes. These cells are cancer (leukemia)
  cells. The leukemia cells do not work like normal lymphocytes and are
  not able to fight infection very well. Also, as the number of leukemia
  cells increases in the blood and bone marrow, there is less room for
  healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. This may
  lead to infection, anemia, and easy bleeding. Cezar received blood and
  platelets and had a port placed so he could begin chemotherapy
  treatments. During the port placement surgery on June 9th, Cezar had
  heart rate complications causing this relatively simple operation to
  take longer than expected. Cezar came out of surgery with a chest tube
  and had to recover in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for two days. Following this surgery, he was diagnosed with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome .
  In Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, an extra electrical pathway
  between the heart's upper and lower chambers causes a rapid heartbeat.
  This additional pathway is present at birth and relatively rare. How
  often a rapid heart rate occurs varies depending on the person. Some
  individuals with WPW syndrome have only a few episodes of rapid heart
  rate. Others may have the rapid heart rate once or twice a week or
  more. Also, there may be no symptoms at all, so like Cezar, WPW is
  found only when a heart test is done for another reason. After his first chest tube was removed, Cezar had complications which
  led to another surgery to remove fluid that had built up around his
  heart and lung. This meant more chest tubes and another PICU stay.
  This second hospital stay lasted nine days, and Cezar received chemo,
  a lumbar puncture, blood and platelets three times, three abdominal
  x-rays, 14 chest x-rays, a lymph node scan, an EKG, and echo and a
  bone marrow aspirate. Cezar’s parents were shocked when the
    results from the bone marrow aspirate changed his diagnosis from
    Pre-B cell ALL to Philadelphia+ Pre-B cell ALL, a form of leukemia
    that only has a 30% survival rate. Their hearts sank with
  fear for their young son but were told that if he uses the medication Gleevec every day it could increase his survival
  rate to 70%. Cezar now takes Gleevec every day, through a feeding tube
  that was placed because he could not take this strong medication by
  mouth without throwing up. One of the complications Cezar has suffered from his time spent
  confined to a hospital bed is the loss of range of motion in his
  ankles. His muscle mass decreased so much so that he could not even
  stand, let alone walk. Cezar started physical therapy and for many
  months had to use braces and a walker to get around. With continued
  physical therapy, Cezar has increased his range of motion and his
  overall strength. Cezar has been in treatment for less than a year and still has a long
  road ahead of him battling ALL. He typically spends around two weeks
  per month in the hospital, which has taken an enormous financial toll
  on his family’s finances. His father, David, is a custodian at the Tennessee Valley Authority in Chattanooga while
  his mother, Rebecca, attends to Cezar’s health issues. It has been a
  rough year, and they are behind on bills and have many out of pocket
  medical expenses. This is where Ride to Give has offered to step in and offer
    the Maldonado family our support.  On Sunday, May 21st, six members
    of Team Ride to Give will participate in Ironman 70.3 Chattanooga on
    behalf of Cezar. They will proudly battle the half-Ironman race
    course while Cezar bravely battles cancer. For updates, please join Cezar's Facebook Group, ""Cezar 's journey"" Contributions are solicited with the

Keeney Ride To Give 3.0 4065 Kelly Meredith Ride To Give 3.0 4065 George Abrams 1108 Erik and Patty Heine of Oklahoma City, OK were excited to welcome
  their first child, a son Stephen, in 2007. After he was born, the
  Heines observed Stephen had broad thumbs and toes, which they found
  odd but endearing. He also had a LOT of hair! From birth, Stephen
  struggled with feeding which caused him to have trouble gaining
  weight. It was frustrating, but they chalked it up to reflux and enjoy
  their sweet new baby. As he grew, Stephen hit his milestones on time, but always at the
  late end of the ""normal"" range. When Stephen was nine months
  old, he had hernia surgery, which led to the discovery of a heart
  murmur and a kidney abnormality. Following surgery, Stephen's physical
  development stalled, and at one year old, he was referred for Early
  Intervention for therapies. There were still lingering
    questions about his health issues, and after additional testing,
    Stephen was diagnosed with Rubinstein Taybi Syndrome in
    May of 2008. Rubinstein Taybi Syndrome , a
  genetic disorder which affects approximately 1:250,000 births, is
  characterized by short stature, moderate to severe intellectual
  disability, distinctive facial features, and broad thumbs and first
  toes. Additional features of the disorder can include eye
  abnormalities, heart and kidney defects, dental problems, and obesity.
  These signs and symptoms vary among affected individuals. People with
  this condition have an increased risk of developing noncancerous and
  cancerous tumors, including certain kinds of brain tumors. Cancer of
  blood-forming tissue (leukemia) also occurs more frequently in people
  with Rubinstein Taybi syndrome. Infants born with this severe form of
  the disorder usually survive only into early childhood. Thankfully Stephen’s overall health has balanced out, and he
    is a happy and thriving 4th grader. Currently, Stephen receives private physical and occupational
  therapies, as well as physical, occupational, and speech therapy in
  his school setting.  To meet his goals of independence as an adult,
  Stephen spends approximately 3/4 of his school day with his typically
  developing peers, in the regular education classroom. Also, he has
  difficulty communicating verbally, so he uses Proloquo2Go software on an iPad
  mini to communicate. Doctors have not given the Heines a timeline as to what they should
  expect with Stephen, so they take everything one day at a time.
  They're determined to not let their child's disability or illness keep
  them from doing the things they love and find a way to adapt and make
  that activity possible. Erik is an avid runner, and for years it has
  been an activity he can share with Stephen. Up until recently, they
  have been able to use a traditional running stroller which Stephen has
  now out grown and is not 100% safe for him. After much research, Eric
  found the Blade at www.hoytrunningchairs.com . Hoyt Running Chairs designs and
    manufactures state-of-the-art racing chairs for individuals with
    disabilities. As a subdivision of Southbridge Tool &
    Manufacturing , they are able to custom build each chair to the
    comfort and needs of both the rider and the runner. They pride
    themselves on getting to know their clients and providing them with
    the ultimate racing experience. Mike Didonato , the president of Southbridge
    Tool & Manufacturing first heard the story of Rick and Dick Hoyt in 2009. Dick Hoyt has pushed his son Rick,
      who was diagnosed a spastic quadriplegic with cerebral palsy after
      his birth in 1962, in over 1,000 races including marathons,
      triathlons, and 6 Ironman races. Their story inspired Mike,
    and a few months later he happened to meet Dick Hoyt at a local
    grocery store. Mike mentioned his family’s manufacturing company and
    offered to fix Rick’s chair if needed. The next year, Dick Hoyt
    showed up at Southbridge Tool and Manufacturing and asked if a brand
    new chair could be built for Rick because he was very uncomfortable
    in his original chair. The Signature was built in time for the Hoyts to compete in the 2010 Boston Marathon . The chair was
    beautifully built for comfort, speed, and maneuverability. Soon,
    other teams and families began asking for a chair. In 2014, Mike was
    approached by Nick Sotar , a retired bicycle shop owner, who
    admired The Signature but had some ideas to improve the design. Nick
    presented Mike with a design for a revolutionary new racing chair
    called The Blade , which is easily
    disassembled and can be shipped in a bike box. After Stephen was diagnosed with Rubinstein Taybi syndrome at 18
  months old, it took almost seven years before they were able to get
  him on non-income-based Medicaid. As a result, the Heines ate through
  their entire family savings paying for medical bills and therapies
  even with insurance. Unfortunately, the cost of a Blade racing
    wheelchair is approximately 10% of Erik’s gross annual
  salary as a Professor of Music at Oklahoma City University ,
  and not something they have sitting around or in a savings account.
  The Blade has not been deemed ""essential"" by their
  insurance. However, Stephen's Occupational and Physical Therapists
  both believe that a chair that he can use for over a decade IS
  essential to helping him relieve stress and participate in an outdoor
  activity like his typically-developing peers. Ride to Give agrees and wants to provide Stephen with a custom
    built Blade that will fit him perfectly and will be used for years
    to come. Our mission at RTG is to turn athletic ability into
  fundraising power for families with children who are disabled,
  injured, or ill.  We think Stephen and Erik will make fantastic
  ambassadors for Team Ride to Give and we can’t wait to see them race
  for the first time with their new Hoyt Running Chair . Please help us purchase the
  Blade running chair and accessories for Stephen by making a tax
  deductible donation to Ride to Give. At this time, Stephen does not have a Facebook Page of his
    own, so follow Ride to GIve on Facebook for all updates. Contributions are solicited with the understanding that the

"15,725",Ride to Give - Supporting Pray for Anna,U.S. Dollar,,of $15.7k goal,704,"7-year-old Annaston Cox of Altha, FL was born with a Congenital Heart
  Defect called Mitral Valve Prolapse with Insufficiency as well as
  Graves Disease. At the age of 3, she had her first open heart surgery
  to repair a valve, at Shands Children’s Hospital in Gainesville, FL.
  Just before she was taken back for surgery, Anna was given a shot of
  Ativan for separation anxiety, but within seconds she went limp and
  quit breathing. Anna had gone into anaphylactic shock and needed to be
  intubated. Thankfully Anna’s surgeons were able to stabilize her and
  proceed with repairing the valve. After surgery, Anna started gaining
  weight and truly living life to the fullest. She was just like any
  other child… she played t-ball, cheered for the county league football
  team, and competed with the Kitty Katz cheer competition squad up
  until March 2018 when everything changed. Last Winter, Anna started having severe headaches, high fevers,
  unexplained exhaustion, night sweats, and she refused to eat. She
  began to wake during the night screaming about head pain and became
  unable to walk or climb in or out of bed. Her parents, Ron and Tanya
  Cox, grew increasingly concerned and took Anna to her pediatrician
  several times. Blood was drawn twice a week for a month, along with
  frequent X-rays and CT scans but Anna’s doctors were stumped, saying
  it was either a blood disorder or autoimmune disease. Anna continued
  to suffer. At her wit's end, Tanya demanded answers, refusing to leave the
  pediatrician’s office until she got them. That same day, April 4,
  2018, Anna was admitted to Tallahassee Memorial Hospital where after
  even more testing they still had no definitive answers except that
  Anna might have an autoimmune disease, Meningitis or a bone marrow disorder. On April 7th, 2018, Anna was transferred by ambulance to the Cardiac
  ICU at Shand’s Children’s Hospital in Gainesville. A few hours after
  they arrived, the Cox were told that Anna had Infective Endocarditis;
  strep bacteria had entered her bloodstream and settled on her Mitral
  Valve. Anna was started on aggressive antibiotics, and numerous
  additional tests were run. When Anna’s eyes were checked, the doctor
  noticed that her optic nerves were swollen and her pupils didn’t react
  to light as they should, so an emergency MRI was ordered. While lying in the hospital bed comforting her daughter, a
    team of doctors came in and told Tanya that the MRI had shown
    several small blood clots on both sides of Anna’s brain and that she
    had already had a few “silent” strokes. The pressure from the blood
    clots explained why Anna’s optic nerves were swollen as well as her
    severe head pain. Then Tanya was told the devastating news that they
    had found an aneurysm on the back of her brain and in at that moment
    Tanya realized how truly sick Anna was and was heartbroken. Anna needed her infected valve replaced with a mechanical one, but
  the heart surgeon chose to wait because there was a strong chance of a
  major stroke if her aneurysm burst. Anna’s neurosurgeon was concerned
  because the bacteria was settled on the valve which was still
  producing blot clots. They knew any one of those clots could be fatal.
  The Cox were told without the heart valve replacement Anna would have
  a heart attack, but there was still a strong chance she could suffer a
  deadly stroke. Ronald and Tanya struggled with this decision for two
  weeks until a blot clot moved into Anna's lung and the decision was
  taken out of their hands. On May 1, 2018, Anna had open heart surgery, and her damaged heart
  valve was replaced with a mechanical valve. Thankfully the surgery
  went well, and the doctors were able to remove all the bacteria. In
  the days to follow, Anna was recovering so well that her doctors began
  discussing a discharge date to the step-down unit, but that all
  changed on May 5th, 2018 when Anna woke up around 3 am screaming for
  help. Tanya ran to the bedside and found Anna sitting straight up with
  her eyes fixed to the right and her arms and legs drawn up and rigid.
  Tanya's sweet daughter couldn't see and the head pain was unbearable. Tanya knew in her heart that Anna was having a stroke and just
    as the hospital staff rushed into the room, Anna went limp and quit
    breathing. After being stabilized, Anna had an emergency craniotomy to
  evacuate the hemorrhage that had caused the stroke. Because she had
  just had major heart surgery three days earlier, the neurosurgeon gave
  Anna 2% chance to live through the procedure. The Cox's were told that
  Anna would most likely never awaken following surgery because of the
  extensive damage to her brain. They said she would probably be in a
  coma and on a ventilator and have little to no quality of life. On June 11th, 2018, Anna was transferred to Brooks
    Rehabilitation for in-patient therapy but was discharged on June
    26th because she made little progress during her two weeks stay. So
    with no preparation and still waiting for Anna’s insurance to
    update, the Cox's brought their daughter home. The past two
  months have been emotionally, physically, and financially draining for
  Tanya, Ronald, and their three other children. They have had to travel
  roughly three hours each way from their home in Altha to Anna’s
  specialist, all with two-year-old Branson in toe. Ronald is the
  manager at Roadmart in Marianna, FL and while management has been very
  understanding, his frequent absences from work have had a negative
  impact on the family finances. Anna is almost three months post-surgery and still is unable to say
  any words, follow commands, or communicate. The neurosurgeon told the
  Cox family that sadly Anna’s overall long-term prognosis is poor, but
  Tanya and Ronald refuse to give up on their daughter. There are so
  many things that are needed for Anna that insurance has yet to approve
  or may not cover. The Cox's want to provide the best possible future
  for Anna, but without the necessary equipment, it has been
  challenging. What Anna really needs most is a wheelchair, a
    stander, and a special needs activity seat so she can do therapy at
    home as well as become more mobile. Also, at this time their
    insurance is not covering her tube feeding, so they have to cover
    the $800 a month cost of her supplies out of pocket as well. When Ride to Give read Anna story we knew we had to support
    Tanya and Ronald as they do their best to provide as bright a future
    as that can for their daughter. The funds we raise will
  help fill in the financial gaps while they await insurance decisions
  regarding Anna's equipment needs, her tube feeding supplies, and help
  cover the costs for now twice-weekly trip Gainesville to see Anna’s
  medical team. Please help Ride to Give as we support this sweet family
